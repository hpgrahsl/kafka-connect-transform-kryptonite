**Disclaimer: This is an UNOFFICIAL community project!**

### Overview

Kryptonite is a library to do field-level cryptography for records on their way into and out of [Apache KafkaÂ®](https://kafka.apache.org/). Currently, it targets two main use cases:

1. [data integration scenarios](connect-transform-kryptonite/README.md) based on [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) by means of a turn-key ready [transformation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_transforms) (SMT) to run encryption / decryption operations on selected fields of records with or without schema.
2. [stream processing scenarios](ksqldb-udfs-kryptonite/README.md) based on [ksqlDB](https://ksqlDB.io) by providing custom [user-defined functions](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/reference/user-defined-functions/) (UDF) to encrypt / decrypt selected data columns in STREAMs and TABLEs respectively.

### Build, Installation and Deployment

Either you build this project from sources via Maven or you can download pre-built, self-contained packages of the latest Kryptonite artefacts.

##### Kafka Connect SMT

The pre-built Kafka Connect SMT can be downloaded from here [kafka-connect-transform-kryptonite-0.X.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bpJxHCXBrx2p2uqTg9ipBoYqrpZuDJNN/view?usp=sharing)

In order to deploy this custom SMT **put the jar into your _'connect plugin path'_** that is configured to be scanned during boostrap of the kafka connect worker node(s).

After that, configure Kryptonite's `CipherField` transformation for any of your source / sink connectors.

##### ksqlDB UDFs

The pre-built ksqlDB UDFs can be downloaded from here [ksqldb-udfs-kryptonite-0.1.0-EXPERIMENTAL.jar]()

In order to deploy the UDFs **put the jar into your _'ksql extension directory'_** that is configured to be scanned during bootstrap of the ksqldb server process(es).

After that, start using the UDFs, namely `K4KENCRYPT` and `K4KDECRYPT`, to selectively encrypt and decrypt column values in ksqlDB rows of _TABLES_ and _STREAMS_ respectively.
